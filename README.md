# Resume as Code

This repo maintains my resume in LaTeX format and the rendered versions get put into the output folder in PDF format. This makes the format maintainable in a checked-in format and makes it easy to modify and make changes to. 


### Why LaTeX format?
LaTeX is markup language originally created in 1984 which describes the layout and content of the documents and leaves formatting to a different code. This means that you have to compile/render the document to view it but this also means that you do not need to worry about fonts or other details when updating or writing the Resume.

### Why PDF format?
Word documents are often requested due to the ease of parsing engines, however they lose formatting and fonts if they are not installed on the remote machine. When using PDF format, the formatting and fonts are included in the document and will always display the same way. This means the way the person intended the resume to be viewed is the way that the viewer will see it.
