I read the opportunity description for \$Role with great interest and would like to learn more about it.
To give you a brief overview of my skill set - I have been with Questis for almost 3 years and have been in charge of Operations and Security for all systems as the Director of IT Operations and DevOps Lead for over 1 1/2 years.

I have migrated multiple applications from on-premise and Heroku to AWS, designed multiple system architectures for several DoD and commercial projects, contributed to several open-source projects, and volunteer at multiple security conferences every year. 

I currently hold multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) certifications as well as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification.  Prior to Questis, I have worked for multiple government agencies as well as commercial companies and have over 17 years of industry experience spanning security, engineering, operations, networking, and cryptography.  In the past I have held fully remote positions and understand the self discipline required to do so.
As you know, a resume is only a brief list of accomplishments so if the position is still available and you feel I may be a possible fit, I would like to discuss it further.
