I read the opportunity description for XXX with great interest and would like to learn more about it.

I have migrated dozens of applications from on-premise to AWS, designed multiple system architectures for several DoD and commercial projects, contributed to multiple open-source projects, and volunteer at multiple security conferences every year.

I currently hold multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) certifications as well as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification.  Prior to XXXX, I have worked for several government agencies as well as commercial companies and have over 17 years of industry experience spanning security, engineering, operations, networking, and cryptography.  In the past I have held fully remote positions and understand the self discipline required to do so.
As you know, a resume is only a brief list of accomplishments so if the position is still available, I would like to discuss it further.
