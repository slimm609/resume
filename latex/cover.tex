I read the opportunity description for XXX with great interest and would like to learn more about it.

I am a Staff 2 Architect and the Security and Compliance Lead for the VMware Developer Platform, which is the underlying Kubernetes platform for VMware Cloud on AWS, Carbon Black, Tanzu Mission Control, NSX, and numerous others VMware SaaS services currently support 70+ teams and over 3000 Developers.

I am 4x Amazon Web Services (AWS) certified including both professional certifications, Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certified, and others. Prior to VMware, I have worked for several government agencies as well as commercial companies and have over 19 years of industry experience spanning security, engineering, operations, networking, and cryptography.

As you know, a resume is only a brief list of accomplishments so if the position is still available, I would be interested in discussing it further.
